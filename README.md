Explanation of Adjustments

Vertex Positions for Medium Size:

The top vertex is set to y = 0.8 to reduce the height slightly, making it more balanced.
The bottom vertices are set to x = -0.8 and x = 0.8, creating a medium-sized base that keeps the triangle within the canvas boundaries.
Canvas Size:
The canvas is still 600x600, allowing the triangle to appear centered and pyramid-like in a medium size.

This should create a triangle that fills a good portion of the canvas, resembling a "pyramid" shape without being overly large.
